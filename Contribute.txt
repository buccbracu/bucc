Future Work for the Brac University Computer Club Website

Welcome to the Brac University Computer Club website repository! We encourage open-source contributions to improve and expand the website's features. Below are some of the key areas we plan to enhance, and we'd love to have your help in making them a reality.

1. Website Features to Implement
- About Us Section: Create a detailed "About Us" section that describes the club's mission, goals, and activities.
- Events Page: Implement a fully functional "Events" page that displays information about current and past events.
  - Each event should include a title, description, date, and images.
  - Add small tags to categorize events, e.g., "Upcoming", "Completed", "Exclusive", etc.
  - Display upcoming events on the landing page. If there are fewer than 3 upcoming events, show the latest completed event instead.
- Gallery Section: Implement a gallery to showcase images and videos from our club events and activities.
- Contact Page: Create a contact form or a "Contact Us" section where visitors can reach out to the club for inquiries.

2. Press Release Section
- Introduce a "Press Release" section on the website, where PR department members can easily upload press releases directly from their accounts. This feature will streamline the communication of club news and announcements.

3. Landing Page Update
- Modify the landing page to display upcoming events on the upper section. The page should pull data from the event database and display events dynamically.
- Ensure that if there are fewer than 3 upcoming events, the page will show the latest completed event, sorted by date.
