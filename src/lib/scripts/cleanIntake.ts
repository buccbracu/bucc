/**
 * Clean Intake Script
 * 
 * This script removes all non-accepted applicants from the current intake cycle.
 * It's designed to be run after the intake process is complete and before opening
 * a new intake cycle, allowing rejected or no-show applicants to re-apply.
 * 
 * What it deletes:
 * - PreregMemberInfo: Pre-registration records
 * - MemberEBAssessment: Evaluation/Assessment records
 * - IntervieweeAttendance: Interview attendance tracking
 * - MemberInfo: Member information (if created but not accepted)
 * - UserAuth: User authentication accounts (only for never-accepted members)
 * 
 * What it keeps:
 * - All records with status "Accepted"
 * - UserAuth accounts for accepted members
 * 
 * Run this script with:
 * node dist/lib/scripts/cleanIntake.js
 * OR
 * tsx src/lib/scripts/cleanIntake.ts
